# Tournages_Paris

I deployed the React App on the following address : https://tournages-paris.vercel.app/

For this App, I used the open data API provided by the city of Paris https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/lieux-de-tournage-a-paris/api/

I am also using the Open Street Map thanks to the Leaflet API.
